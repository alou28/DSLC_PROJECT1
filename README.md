Introduction:

The goal of this project is to apply some concepts & tools to multiple part of the project:
For this project we will be using the main data of dataset of home and credit risk classification from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk

It contains various informations about previous loans and the if the loans has been repayed by the borrower.

Goals :

Part 1: Buil a Classical ML projects with respect to basic ML Coding best practices
Part 2: Integrate MLFlow to our project
Part 3: Integrate ML Interpretability to our project which is about shap


Project Organization

Data Exploration

Feature Engineering

The first part of the project is to build an ML Project with respect of using 3 machine learning models:
Random Forest
XGBoost
Gradient Boosting
But our goal isn't just to create three machine learning models. Indeed, these models' accuracies aren't very important. In fact the real goal is to implement multiple tools into the project, in order to make the project more understandable for everyone. The tools to be used are:

Git
Conda environment
Mlflow
SHAP
Structuration
After creating a Git repository and granting access to everyone that needed it, we decided to start computing models on Jupyter Lab in a Conda environment. We decided to not use multiple branches in the Git repository, as we thought it wasn't necessary. For the project documentation, we used Sphinx.
